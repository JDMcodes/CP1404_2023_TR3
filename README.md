# Jarred Muller's CP1404 Practicals
## Introduction

I am Jarred Muller, a third year Data Science student at James Cook University, and this repo contains the practicals completed by myself in CP1404 during Trimester 3 in 2023.

## What I have learnt about clean coding in CP1404?
- Naming variables and functions in clear and consistent formats is crucial for allowing others to understand your code.  
- Inappropriate use of global variables can make your code hard to understand and can cause problems in functions.
- Keep it simple and don't bloat your code with unnecessary steps and lines of code.
